# node-ReadMe

## Description

I built a README.md file generator that can be used from the command terminal. 
My motivation for building this project is to quickly be able to make a professional README 
With optimum structure to the file. This helps resolve the issue of lacking information and structure. Along the way I learned how to install node packages and set them up to run the proper manager, how to combine js files, write templates and submit information to the template js file.  

## Installation
